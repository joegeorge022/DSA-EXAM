## Experiment List

- [x] 1. Find the sum of two polynomials using arrays.

- [x] 2. Find the sum of two sparse matrices and transpose the resultant matrix.

- [ ] 3. Convert infix expression to postfix (or prefix) and then evaluate using stack.

- [ ] 4. Implement Queue, DEQUEUE, and Circular Queue using arrays.

- [ ] 5. Implement Circular Queue using arrays.

- [x] 6. Implement backward and forward navigation of visited web pages in a web browser (i.e. back and forward buttons) using doubly linked list operations.

- [x] 7. Implement addition of polynomials using singly linked lists.

- [ ] 8. Create a binary tree for a given simple arithmetic expression and find the prefix / postfix equivalent.

- [ ] 9. Implement binary search trees by performing insertion, search, and deletion of numbers using linked list.

- [x] 10. Implement BFS using arrays.

- [ ] 11. Given an array of sorted items, implement an efficient algorithm to search for a specific item in the array and also find the time and space complexities.

- [ ] 12. Implement Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort and compare the number of steps involved.

- [ ] 13. Simulation of a basic memory allocator and garbage collector using doubly linked list.

- [x] 14. You are given a hash table with 10 slots (indexed from 0 to 9). You are also provided with a set of integers that need to be inserted into the hash table using a hash function.
